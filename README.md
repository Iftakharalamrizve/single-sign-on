Single sign-on (SSO) is an authentication scheme that allows a user to log in with a single ID to any of several related, yet independent, software systems. SSO supporters place emphasis on reducing the risk of password fatigue and improvement of usability in terms of perceived corporate identity between different services of the same provider.

Conversely, single sign-off or single log-out (SLO) is the property whereby a single action of signing out terminates access to multiple software systems.

Project Use Case: Single Sign-On (SSO) Implementation üëç

Use Case Name: Single Sign-On (SSO) Implementation for Corporate Applications

**Stakeholders and Interests:**

- Employees : Desire a simplified and secure login process to access multiple corporate applications.

- IT Department : Seeks to streamline user management, enhance security, and reduce the burden of password resets and account administration.

- Security Team : Aims to implement a centralized authentication mechanism to enforce strong security policies and improve overall security.

- Management : Interested in improving productivity and user satisfaction while reducing operational costs.

Preconditions:

- The SSO solution has been selected and configured.

- User accounts are provisioned and synchronized with the SSO system.

- Integrated applications are ready to support SSO authentication.

Postconditions:

- Employees can access all integrated corporate applications using a single set of credentials.

- User login and access activities are logged and monitored for security purposes.

- The SSO system is operational, providing seamless access to authorized applications.

**Main Success Scenario :**

- User Login:

  - Trigger : An employee attempts to access a corporate application.

  - Action :The employee is redirected to the SSO login page.

  - Interaction : The employee enters their single set of credentials (username and password).

  - ¬†System Response: The SSO system authenticates the user against the central directory.

- Access Granted:

  - Action: Upon successful authentication, the employee is redirected back to the requested application.

  - ¬†Interaction: The application verifies the authentication token provided by the SSO system.

  - ¬†System Response: The employee is granted access to the application without needing to log in again.

* Application Switching :

  - Trigger: The employee needs to access another corporate application.

  - Action: The employee selects the new application.

  - Interaction: The employee is automatically authenticated by the SSO system.

  - System Response: The employee gains immediate access to the new application without re-entering credentials.

* Session Management :

  - ¬†Action: The employee remains logged in across all integrated applications until they explicitly log out or the session expires.

  - Interaction: Logging out from any application can trigger a global logout, ending the session for all applications.

  - System Response: The SSO system terminates the session, and the employee is logged out from all applications.

- Application Switching:

  - ¬†Trigger : The employee needs to access another corporate application.

  - ¬†Action: The employee selects the new application.

  - ¬†Interaction: The employee is automatically authenticated by the SSO system.

  - ¬†System Response: The employee gains immediate access to the new application without re-entering credentials.

* Session Management:

  - ¬†Action: The employee remains logged in across all integrated applications until they explicitly log out or the session expires.

  - Interaction: Logging out from any application can trigger a global logout, ending the session for all applications.

  - System Response: The SSO system terminates the session, and the employee is logged out from all applications.

**Extensions (Alternate Scenarios):**

- Authentication Failure:

  - Trigger : The employee enters incorrect credentials.

  - Action¬† : The SSO system displays an error message and prompts for re-entry of credentials.

  - System Response : After several failed attempts, the system locks the account and notifies the IT department for security purposes.

- Password Reset:

  - Trigger : The employee forgets their password.

  - Action : The employee selects the "Forgot Password" option on the SSO login page.

  - Interaction : The SSO system guides the employee through the password reset process (e.g., via email verification).

  - System Response: The employee sets a new password and gains access to the SSO system.

* Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA):

  - Trigger : The organization enforces MFA for additional security.

  - Action : After entering credentials, the employee is prompted for a second authentication factor (e.g., a code sent to their phone).

  - Interaction : The employee enters the MFA code.

  - System Response : Upon successful MFA verification, the employee is granted access.

Special Requirements:

1. The SSO system must support integration with all existing corporate applications.

2. The SSO solution should comply with industry standards and security best practices.

3. The system should be scalable to accommodate future applications and users.

4. Comprehensive logging and monitoring should be in place for auditing and security purposes.

Frequency of Use:

1. Daily, by all employees needing access to corporate applications.

Open Issues :

1. ¬†Integration challenges with legacy applications.

2. ¬†Ensuring all employees are adequately trained to use the SSO system.

3. ¬†Addressing any privacy concerns related to centralized authentication.

4.

By implementing this SSO use case, the organization will achieve a streamlined, secure, and user-friendly authentication process, enhancing both security and productivity.
